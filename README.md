# Remote Talent Recruitment Website (HTML/CSS Demo)

This is a demo project of a modern, responsive website focused on remote team building and global talent recruitment. The design is based on a fictional company that helps businesses build and manage distributed teams efficiently.

## üìå Project Highlights
